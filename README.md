# Daily-DSA
A structured repository dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. This project tracks my progress through the comprehensive A2Z Sheet by Striver, featuring optimized solutions and deep dives into algorithmic patterns.

## 📊 Progress at a Glance
| Section | Topic | Status | Solutions |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| **Step 1** | Learn the Basics | 15/15 | [View](./Step-01) |
| **Step 2** | Sorting Techniques | 03/07 | [View](./Step-02) |
| **Step 3** | Arrays (Easy to Hard) | 00/40 | [View](./Step-03) |

## 🛠️ Key Technical Highlights
- **Language:** Java
- **Complexity Analysis:** Every solution includes a header with Big-O Time & Space complexity.
- **Problem Range:** Covers patterns from basic sorting to advanced Dynamic Programming and Graphs.

## 📂 Repository Organization
The repository follows the TUF+ curriculum structure for easy navigation:
- `Step-XX`: Main category folder.
- Each file is named clearly (e.g., `TwoSumOptimal.java`) and contains comments on the logic used.

## 📈 Learning Goals
- Master the patterns to identify and solve the problems quickly.
- Achieve O(1) space complexity where possible using bit manipulation.
- Build a consistent daily coding habit.
